# espnNBASalaries
A web scraper for grabbing NBA salaries and computing statistics based on information found.


HOW TO RUN:

Simply compile, dotnet restore, dotnet build, dotnet run.
It will place a few files in the direcory that you have saved this .cs file in. 
These files are the statistics produced based on the inputs of the website. 

THIS PROJECT WILL FAIL WITH ERRORS:
-> The graphical portion of the code does NOT work. (I won't be fixing it lol)
